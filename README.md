- Syntax-highlighted JSON editor with error messages for invalid JSON.
- Dynamic form preview with support for all field types.
- Real-time form validation and error handling.
- Mobile-responsive layout with stacked editor and form preview on smaller screens.
- Form submission logs data to the console with a success message.
- Built-in tests for functionality and responsiveness.
